In this 3 part exercise, you will write code that calculates the most common words from [Complete Works of William Shakespeare](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100).\n\n- Here are the brief steps for writing the word counting program:\n\n> - Create a base RDD from `Complete_Shakespeare.txt` file.\n> - Use RDD transformation to create a long list of words from each element of the base RDD.\n> - Remove stop words from your data.\n> - Create pair RDD where each element is a pair tuple of `('w', 1)`\n> - Group the elements of the pair RDD by key (word) and add up their values.\n> - Swap the keys (word) and values (counts) so that keys is count and value is the word.\n> - Finally, sort the RDD by descending order and print the 10 most frequent words and their frequencies.\n\n- In this first exercise, you'll create a base RDD from `Complete_Shakespeare.txt` file and transform it to create a long list of words.\n\n- Remember, you already have a `SparkContext` `sc` already available in your workspace.
