PySpark automatically creates a `SparkContext` for you in the `PySpark` shell (so you don't have to create it by yourself) and is exposed via a variable `sc`.\n\n- In this simple exercise, you'll find out the attributes of the `SparkContext` in your PySpark shell which you'll be using for the rest of the course.\n\n## Instructions\n- Print the version of `SparkContext` in the PySpark shell.\n- Print the Python version of `SparkContext` in the PySpark shell.\n- What is the master of SparkContext in the PySpark shell?","user":"anonymous","dateUpdated":"2021-02-26T11:26:48+0530","config":{"tableHide":false,"editorSetting":{"language":"markdown","editOnDblClick":true,"completionKey":"TAB","completionSupport":false},"colWidth":12,"editorMode":"ace/mode/markdown","fontSize":9,"editorHide":true,"results":{},"enabled":true},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1614319008673_-929639218","id":"20201113-111914_205968237","dateCreated":"2021-02-26T11:26:48+0530","status":"READY","errorMessage":"","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"focus":true,"$$hashKey":"object:1168"},{"text":"%pyspark\n\n# script.py\n\n# Print the version of SparkContext\nprint(\"The version of Spark Context in the PySpark shell is\", sc._____)\n\n# Print the Python version of SparkContext\nprint(\"The Python version of Spark Context in the PySpark shell is\", sc._____)\n\n# Print the master of SparkContext\nprint(\"The master of Spark Context in the PySpark shell is\", sc._____)\n","user":"anonymous","dateUpdated":"2021-02-26T11:28:03+0530","config":{"editorSetting":{"language":"python","editOnDblClick":false,"completionKey":"TAB","completionSupport":true},"colWidth":12,"editorMode":"ace/mode/python","fontSize":9,"results":{},"enabled":true},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1614319008694_402512570","id":"20201113-112611_1449842881","dateCreated":"2021-02-26T11:26:48+0530","dateStarted":"2021-02-26T11:28:03+0530","dateFinished":"2021-02-26T11:28:03+0530","status":"ERROR","errorMessage":"","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:1169"},{"text":"%pyspark\n\nprint(\"The version of Spark Context in the PySpark shell is\", sc.version)\n\nprint(\"The Python version of Spark Context in the PySpark shell is\", sc.pythonVer)\n\nprint(\"The master of Spark Context in the PySpark shell is\", sc.master)","user":"anonymous","dateUpdated":"2021-02-26T11:30:27+0530","config":{"colWidth":12,"fontSize":9,"enabled":true,"results":{},"editorSetting":{"language":"python","editOnDblClick":false,"completionKey":"TAB","completionSupport":true},"editorMode":"ace/mode/python"},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"results":{"code":"SUCCESS","msg":[{"type":"TEXT","data":"The version of Spark Context in the PySpark shell is 2.4.5\nThe Python version of Spark Context in the PySpark shell is 3.6\nThe master of Spark Context in the PySpark shell is local[*]\n"}]},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1614319083465_605255168","id":"20210226-112803_1263782797","dateCreated":"2021-02-26T11:28:03+0530","dateStarted":"2021-02-26T11:30:27+0530","dateFinished":"2021-02-26T11:30:27+0530","status":"FINISHED","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:1170"},{"text":"%pyspark\n","user":"anonymous","dateUpdated":"2021-02-26T11:29:27+0530","config":{"colWidth":12,"fontSize":9,"enabled":true,"results":{},"editorSetting":{"language":"python","editOnDblClick":false,"completionKey":"TAB","completionSupport":true},"editorMode":"ace/mode/python"},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1614319167720_-114741781","id":"20210226-112927_1549251589","dateCreated":"2021-02-26T11:29:27+0530","status":"READY","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:1171"}],"name":"/BDFWithPySpark/M1/SM2/Ex1","id":"2FZA48RWX","noteParams":{},"noteForms":{},"angularObjects":{"md:shared_process":[],"sh:shared_process":[],"spark:shared_process":[]},"config":{"isZeppelinNotebookCronEnable":false,"looknfeel":"default","personalizedMode":"false"},"info":{}}
